# AI-Anime-Girl-Cat-Classifier
An AI project which can distinguish between cats and anime girls since we all know that anime girls are based off of cats.

**Steps to run**
# 1. Download the zip file
Download the zip file from the releases, and put it in your google drive.

# 2. Extract the files on Colab
Run the first 3 code cells in the colab file in order

# 3. Test some images!
Run the very bottom code cell and upload some images of your choice and see if they're a cat or an anime character

# Known issues
Because our dataset for the anime characters only use portraits with white backgrounds, it can often confuse intricate backgrounds that match an anime character's design well with the shape of a cat, thus causing it to guess that your image may be a cat. Transparent PNGs also cause the program to crash, but you can easily rerun and use snipping tool instead.
